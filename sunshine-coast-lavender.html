          <p class="project-description">Sunshine Coast Lavender is a small, grassroots body care brand from Sunshine Coast, known for its handmade products and loyal local following. As the company expands into retail, this rebrand focuses on refining its identity and packaging.</p>
          <p class="project-description">The packaging lineup for three cosmetic products was redesigned using sustainable materials such as glass bottles and silk screen printing with soy-based inks. Each box is constructed to protect the glass bottles while acting as the main storytelling surface, highlighting product benefits, ingredients, and the brand’s mission.</p>
           <p class="project-description">This project was guided by my amazing mentor, Laura Prpich at <a href="https://www.cariboucreative.ca/">Caribou Creative.</a></p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Sunshine Coast Lavender started as a grass-roots brand, designed in-house by a non-designer (the owner) and with a minimal print budget. Their brand is primarily online and has an existing loyal clientele within the Sunshine Coast markets and community, but are now trying to expand further into BC and have been offered a deal to feature select products at retailers. As a lavender product consumer myself, I recognize the need to elevate the brand so it can confidently sit on shelves alongside its competitors is essential to this retailer relationship and the success of Sunshine Coast Lavender's projected growth.</p>
          </div>
             <div class="project-title col-2">
            <h2>Demographic</h2>
            <p>After looking into Sunshine Coast’s townspeople and business culture and experiencing it myself, my findings were exactly what I expected and fit in extremely with Vancouver’s diverse consumers. While Sunshine Coast Lavender provides authentic materials for all people, their largest clientele are women in their mid twenties and above residing in Sechelt because of their community connections, a proven natural concept, and high demand of their products.</p>

<p>As SCL prides themselves in the labour of carefully harvested lavender, their products are priced moderately above average from what you would see in the standard LUSH store. There is security in this as consumers will be reassured they are getting good quality for their purchases. This also works out for the target market as women in this developed stage of adulthood tend to have wiser financial decisions and capabilities, as well as experience in positive and negative wellness product markets.

            <h2>Logo Exploration</h2>
            <p>Creating Sunshine Coast Lavender's new logo was no easy task. I wanted to stay faithful to the original design—outdated as it was—yet give it a cleaner finish. After countless rounds of revisions, I was able to narrow the logo down to a wordmark and monogram to use on various parts of the packaging.</p>
